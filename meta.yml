  ## Development information

  On April 2, 2023, a file `smooth_trajectories.v` was added to illustrate a
  program to compute smooth trajectories for a "point" between obstacles given
  by straight edges.

  The example can be played with by changing the contents of variables 
  `example_bottom`, `example_top`, `example_edge_list`, and changing
  the coordinates of points given as argument to `example_test` in the
  `Compute` command that appears at the end of the file.  This compute
   commands produces text that should be placed in a postscript file and
   can be displayed with any postscript enabled viewer.  A perl-script is
   provided to produce this, so that the following command is a handy
   way to produce example outputs:

   ```
   (cd theories; coqc smooth_trajectories.v | ../coq_output_to_postscript.pl)
   ```

  At the time of writing this paragraph, the code is incomplete, in
  the sense that it won't compute a
  trajectory between points if either the source or the target are at the
  exact intersection between to adacent cells.

  If you play with this code and you obtain a trajectory that obviously
  crosses the given edges.
